# MoneroswapProtocol

A Decentralized & Trustless Cross Chain Protocol developing a solution in development for non-custodial swaps of Monero (XMR) that places user privacy at the forefront. Crafted by a dedicated team under the Moneroswap Project, this open-source initiative aims to revolutionize the way Monero is exchanged with other blockchain assets.

Work on the project began in early 2024 and was shelved in late 2024 due to financal constraints. The Moneroswap Project is a non profit team of developers building the project. Anyone is free to contribute or fork the code. Developers who are experienced in Smart contracts, Python, Swapkit SDK & Monero Blockchain development are welcome to volunteer for the Moneroswap Project by contacting us.
